       This WebApp is based on OpenWeatherMap as the default service provider. 
       <p/>
       Feathers of this WebApp includes:
       <p/>
       1. a cache layer has been built to resolve the limit of the query frequency and speed. The free license of OpenWeatherMap only allows queries no sooner than 10 minutes, and the service is not fast. The added caching can dramatically enhance the user experience.<br/> The cache does synchronized loading for its first time loading and do asynchronized refresh afterwards.
       <p/>
       2. Information providers can be extended to others if it's in need by implements WeatherProviderService interface. Likewise, the web application can be extended to provide more service by implements functions, e.g. 5 days forecast, 16 days forecast.
       <p/>
       3. The frontend was built on top of rest api. So the GUI changes can be loosely coupled with the backend. Adn also, the rest API can be utilized by 3rd party applications as a benefit.
